A great thank to Mr.Mahesh Naryan (Director ) that he has choosen the life of a suffering middle class Nurse in order to picturise a real life experience , which our Big celebrities and other cultural personalities often forget or ignore to do it . I feel the great survival of a Nurse always attained either she or he always passes through such onerous and abominable life circumstances or it could be continuous struggling , which usually not happens the life of other professionals.Very unsupportive financial status of the family, bank loans , responsibilities toward siblings and parents etc..always puts a Nurse in life where she or he always forget to live themselves. This movie has given me a great principle that the life will be succeded one day ...and also why the American or European people salute or give an offical diginity to a Regesterd Nurse ...even the Indian medical community has not known it ...Thank you the team of Take Off movie , once again that you have awaken the Malayalam movie from the great hibernation of imaginations or world of fictions or from a world of amorphous concepts ...Parvathi...has done a brilliant acting...Pls Dont forget to see the movie .",17608492,brilliant,1,N

Take off, through its impeccable execution of a heavy weight theme gifts the viewers an enthralling emotional experience.Reality is far from being real unless it is experiences firsthand. Take off is inspired by a true story which occurred in the recent past, when a group of Nurses in Iraq were abducted by ISIS terrorists. The news was indeed an impactful one, but it just passed as another impactful news. Take off takes the viewers to the hot seat located at the heart of the battle field, right where the nurses were.

The subject of the movie was the evacuation of Malayali nurses from Iraq in 2014. Many of us had thought and discussed, why these nurses left to Iraq for job even they know the risk involved in that job. This movie is the answer for that.Me and my cousin Martin had seen the shooting of this movie in last August when it was shooted in Sree Narayana Medical College, Chalaka(nearby our home). we met Kunjakko and all there.

A great thank to Mr.Mahesh Naryan (Director ) that he has choosen the life of a suffering middle class Nurse in order to picturise a real life experience , which our Big celebrities and other cultural personalities often forget or ignore to do it . I feel the great survival of a Nurse always attained either she or he always passes through such onerous and abominable life circumstances or it could be continuous struggling , which usually not happens the life of other professionals.Very unsupportive financial status of the family, bank loans , responsibilities toward siblings and parents etc..always puts a Nurse in life where she or he always forget to live themselves. This movie has given me a great principle that the life will be succeded one day ...and also why the American or European people salute or give an offical diginity to a Regesterd Nurse ...even the Indian medical community has not known it ...Thank you the team of Take Off movie , once again that you have awaken the Malayalam movie from the great hibernation of imaginations or world of fictions or from a world of amorphous concepts ...Parvathi...has done a brilliant acting...Pls Dont forget to see the movie .",17608492,brilliant,1,N

Take off, through its impeccable execution of a heavy weight theme gifts the viewers an enthralling emotional experience.Reality is far from being real unless it is experiences firsthand. Take off is inspired by a true story which occurred in the recent past, when a group of Nurses in Iraq were abducted by ISIS terrorists. The news was indeed an impactful one, but it just passed as another impactful news. Take off takes the viewers to the hot seat located at the heart of the battle field, right where the nurses were.

The crew has taken few real videos of Iraq from the medias like CNN and BBC etc i think, even though, it was well edited. The subject of the movie was the evacuation of Malayali nurses from Iraq in 2014. Many of us had thought and discussed, why these nurses left to Iraq for job even they know the risk involved in that job. This movie is the answer for that.Me and my cousin Martin had seen the shooting of this movie in last August when it was shooted in Sree Narayana Medical College, Chalaka(nearby our home). we met Kunjakko and all there.
